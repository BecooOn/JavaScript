At the end of the this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- DOM Manipulation: Understanding how to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to update and modify HTML elements dynamically.

- Event Handling: Gaining proficiency in handling user events, such as button clicks, and implementing appropriate responses or actions in the code.

- Variables and State Management: Learning how to use variables to store and manage the state of a program, in this case, keeping track of scores and the winning score.

- Conditional Statements: Implementing conditional statements to control the flow of the program, making decisions based on certain conditions (e.g., checking if a player has reached the winning score).

- Button and Input Handling: Understanding how to work with buttons and input elements, including adding event listeners to buttons and responding to input changes.

- Styling Changes with JavaScript: Applying dynamic styling changes to HTML elements based on certain conditions, such as changing the color of text when a player wins.
